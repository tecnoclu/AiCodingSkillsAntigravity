# Rule: Generating a Task List from User Requirements

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step task list in Markdown format based on user requirements, feature requests, or existing documentation. The task list should guide a developer through implementation.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `.agent/tasks/`
- **Filename:** `AT-[X]-task-[feature-name].md` (e.g., `AT-8-task-user-profile-editing.md`)
    - **Note**: Check `.agent/STATUS.md` to find the next available `AT-X` number.

## Process

1.  **Receive Requirements:** The user provides a feature request, task description, points to existing documentation, or a PRD (e.g. `prd-[feature].md`).
2.  **Analyze Requirements:** The AI analyzes the functional requirements, user needs, and implementation scope from the provided information.
3.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks:** Based on the requirements analysis, create the file and generate the main, high-level tasks required to implement the feature. **IMPORTANT: Always include task 0.0 "Create feature branch" as the first task, unless the user specifically requests not to create a branch.** Use your judgement on how many additional high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about 5. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level tasks based on your requirements. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
4.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
5.  **Phase 2: Generate Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task and cover the implementation details implied by the requirements.
6.  **Identify Relevant Files:** Based on the tasks and requirements, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Files` section, including corresponding test files if applicable.
7.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
8.  **Save Task List:** Save the generated document in the `.agent/tasks/` directory with the filename `AT-[X]-task-[feature-name].md`.

## Output Format

The generated task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
# Task: [Task Name]
**Parent PRD**: [Link to PRD if applicable]

## Relevant Files

- `path/to/potential/file1.ts` - Brief description of why this file is relevant.
- `path/to/file1.test.ts` - Unit tests for `file1.ts`.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing.

## Instructions for Completing Tasks

**IMPORTANT:** As you complete each task, you must check it off in this markdown file by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`. This helps track progress and ensures you don't skip any steps.

Example:
- `- [ ] 1.1 Read file` → `- [x] 1.1 Read file` (after completing)

Update the file after completing each sub-task.

## Tasks

- [ ] 0.0 Create feature branch
  - [ ] 0.1 Create and checkout a new branch for this feature (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]`)
- [ ] 1.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 [Sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Sub-task description 2.1]
```

## Interaction Model

The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level plan aligns with user expectations before diving into details.

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the task list is a **junior developer** who will implement the feature.
